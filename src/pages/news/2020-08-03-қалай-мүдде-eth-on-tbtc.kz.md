tBTC, which lets people use Bitcoin to access Ethereum DeFi apps, uses a system of random signing groups to process transactions. Signers must bond an amount of ETH equal to 150% the value of the BTC being deposited, in order to disincentivize bad behavior. This 150% bond is forfeited in the event a signer does not perform their required function -- for example, sending a BTC redemption to an incorrect wallet address.
